### Hi! I'm Riki!
I'm a software engineer with experience developing sophisticated web applications using Javascript, React, Redux, Python, Node.js, Express.js, Flask, SQL, postgreSQL, and other technologies.
In my spare time, I love looking for the next rabbit hole youtube's recommendation algorithm has for me , which at the moment is searching for the next 90's techno 12" to be obsessed with.
